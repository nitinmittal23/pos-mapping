### Testnet
Mappings on testnet does not require multisig. mapping can be done by EOA [0xf89154D7A42c5E9f77884511586A9db4618683C5](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xf89154D7A42c5E9f77884511586A9db4618683C5)

Steps:
1. Go to [rootChainManagerProxy](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xBbD7cBFA79faee899Eaf900F13C9065bF03B1A74#writeProxyContract) Contract on goerli.
2. click on `Write as Proxy` and connect account with the above `EOA` address
3. Go to `mapToken` function and enter the details returned by the script and execute transaction
4. Mapping done


### Mainnet
Mappings on mainnet is done via [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x424bDE99FCfB68c5a1218fd3215caFfD031f19C4) on Ethereum chain.

Steps:
1. Add above multisig added in [gnosis](https://app.safe.global/apps?safe=eth:0x424bDE99FCfB68c5a1218fd3215caFfD031f19C4)
2. Open [transaction Builder](https://app.safe.global/share/safe-app?appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapps-portal.safe.global%2Ftx-builder&chain=eth)
3. Add the rootChainManager contract (Make sure that the ABI used is from [implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x37D26DC2890b35924b40574BAc10552794771997) contract but the address used is [Proxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA0c68C638235ee32657e8f720a23ceC1bFc77C77) contract).
4. Select `mapToken` and enter the details returned by the script and initiate transaction
2. Mapping will be done when all the multisig owners sign the transaction and execute it.
